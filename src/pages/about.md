# About Freight

**Freight** is a compiled and type-safe language for general programming,
and is centered around the concept of supply chain management and reusable code.

## Why Freight?

Most, if not all, programming languages tend to consider package management and
the supply chain as an afterthought. Even languages with "official" package
managers and supply chain systems do not actually have syntax support for these
endeavors, instead entrusting such concepts to a third-party set of developers.
Freight was conceived to emphasize the idea of reusable code as a "first-class"
citizen of the language, rather than an afterthought, in order to help combat
the issues programmers face with supply chain attacks and increased strain
on repositories for delivering such packages.
